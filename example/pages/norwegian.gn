[h3|Notes]
[ul|
	[li|Forms of address aren't really used]
	[li|"Takk for sist" is often used when greeting people you haven't seen in a while]
	[li|"Hallo" is mostly for answering the phone, "hei" is an informal greeting, and "god dag" is for more formal situations]
	[li|A common way of saying "how are you" / "how is it going" is "hvordan går det", and "hvordan har du det" is more used for "how are you feeling" ]
	[li|"Du" (you) is used for the subject, as in "Du er Ben" (you are Ben)]
	[li|"Deg" (you) is used for the object, as in "å treffe deg" (to meet you)]
	[li|"Hvordan" is used for open ended questions, such as "hvordan er været" (how is the weather)]
	[li|"Hvor" is used for specific questions, usually with a descriptor, such as "hvor ofte" (how often)]
	[li|"Går" is used for walking, or for expressing the idea of motion when motion does not actually occur]
	[li|"Drar" is either "is leaving", or used to talk about going somewhere or doing something "jeg drar hjem" (I am going home)]
	[li|"Det" is without gender or their]
	[li|"Den" is masc. and fem]
	[li|"De" is it/that/those or they]
	[li|"Ha" is more exclamatory? as in "ha det" (literally, have it)]
	[li|"Hva skjer" is informal: "what's up?" ]
	[li|The definite article (the) gets attached to the end of the noun]
	[li|Possessives can be placed before or after nouns. If the possessive is placed before, it is indefinite, if it is placed after, is is definite (this is more common)]
	[li|Questions are created by placing the verb before the noun ("har du?" is a question - have you - "du har" is a statement - you have)]
	[li|"Også" means "too", "also", and "as well" ]
	[li|There is a gender distinction for cousins, but not for grandchildren]
	[li|All nouns have a grammatical gender, male, female, or neutral, and each has an indefinite and definite article associated with it]
	[li|Future acts are indicated by a verb in present tense combined with an adverb like "later", "tomorrow", etc, or a verb in the infinitive combined with an auxiliary verb like skal]
	[li|Norwegian is generally quite reserved. "Elske" is only really used for someone you love romantically, and "glad i" is used for others (including family)]
	[li|Verbs have the same form for all subjects]
	[li|"-r" is characteristic of present tense]
	[li|There is no conjugation for the present continuation like there is in English, simply use the present tense instead]
	[li|In Norwegian, words describing nationality are not capitalized]
	[li|"Studerte" implies higher level education, such as college or university]
	[li|"-te" is an ending which implies past tense]
	[li|Like in the present, questions in the paste tense are formed by switching the verb and subject; there is no "did" ]
	[li|"Den" goes with a noun in its definite form, so "den skolen" literally means "that the school" ]
	[li|The ending "-et" is the neutral singular definite article]
	[li|"That" is den and det in Norwegian. Den is used with male and female nouns, and det is used with neutral nouns (both go with nouns in definite form)]
